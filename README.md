# 2d-js-platformer

This is going to be a 2d side-scroller

This is a 2d platformer game, created in JavaScript and modeled after side-scrolling platformer games from the 90's (similar to Donkey Kong Country). I am currently creating custom assets to replace the temporary art assets. Potential candidate for the first game for Axora the Axolotl.
